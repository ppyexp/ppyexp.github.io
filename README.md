## symmetry

At *symmetry*, we build visual perception systems for general-purpose robots.

We focused on ubiquitous camera sensors, so our systems can be easily deployed in any low cost, low weight robot. 

Our visual-inertial odometry algorithm allows a robot to locate itself with respect to the environment. Our geometric deep learning algorithm allows the robot to map the occupancy of its surrounding space. These are the fundamentals of any physical robot.

We provide the preception systems in an easy to use package so that you can focus on building the robots.
